# Pyspark-project
Skills practice

This notebook aim to do some practice with Pyspark. I will use some small data so using Pyspark here is actually kind of overkill.
But this notebook is for training purposes only and is meant to give an ideo of how we can use Pyspark to build a machine learning model.
